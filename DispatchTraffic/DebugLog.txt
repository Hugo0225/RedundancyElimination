Step 1:
I randomly select one pcap file and load it into wireshark
By setting filter to "tcp or udp", I get the statistic information which says that

INFORMATION FOR PCAP FILE JAN 04 16-48-19 2013
Packet Captured Dislayed Display% 
	   352827 	352294	 99.849%

Then I run my program(DispatchTraffic) and use my own filter to filter 

Fuck compile error I encounter this error while compiling
libboost_system.so.1.55.0: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
I have project called BoostEnvirTest which verify that both boost_filesytem and boost_regex works
However, Still doesn't work when compiling DispatchTraffic
!Problem sloved, I added -lboost_system before -lboost_filesystem and it worked fine for me now

meaningless information, for now, however

I use wireshark
